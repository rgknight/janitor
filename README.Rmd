**janitor** has simple functions for examining and cleaning dirty data.  It was built with beginning and intermediate R users in mind and is optimized for user-friendliness. Advanced R users can already do everything covered here, but with janitor they can do it faster and save their thinking for the fun stuff.

The main janitor functions:

* perfectly format data.frame column names;
* isolate partially-duplicate records; and 
* provide quick one- and two-variable tabulations (i.e., frequency tables and crosstabs).

Other janitor functions nicely format the results of these tabulations. Together, these tabulate-and-report functions approximate popular features of SPSS and Microsoft Excel.

janitor is a [#tidyverse](https://github.com/hadley/tidyverse/blob/master/vignettes/manifesto.Rmd)-oriented package.  Specifically, it plays nicely with the `%>%` pipe and is optimized for cleaning data brought in with the [readr](https://github.com/hadley/readr) and [readxl](https://github.com/hadley/readxl) packages.


### Installation

You can install:

* the latest released version from CRAN with

    ```R
    install.packages("janitor")
    ````

* the latest development version from GitHub with

    ```R
    if (packageVersion("devtools") < 1.6) {
      install.packages("devtools")
    }
    devtools::install_github("sfirke/janitor")
    ```


## Using janitor

Below are quick examples of how janitor tools are commonly used.  A full description of each function can be found in janitor's [catalog of functions](https://github.com/sfirke/janitor/blob/master/vignettes/introduction.md).  

### Cleaning dirty data

Take this roster of teachers at a fictional American high school, stored in the Microsoft Excel file [dirty_data.xlsx](https://github.com/sfirke/janitor/blob/master/dirty_data.xlsx):
![All kinds of dirty.](dirty_data.PNG)

Dirtiness includes:

* Dreadful column names
* Rows and columns containing Excel formatting but no data
* Dates stored as numbers
* Values spread inconsistently over the "Certification" columns

Here's that data after being read in to R:
```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(pacman) # for loading packages
p_load(readxl, janitor, dplyr)

roster_raw <- read_excel("dirty_data.xlsx") # available at http://github.com/sfirke/janitor
glimpse(roster_raw)
```

Excel formatting led to an untitled empty column and 5 empty rows at the bottom of the table (only 12 records have any actual data).  Bad column names are preserved.

Clean it with janitor functions:
```{r}
roster <- roster_raw %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  remove_empty_rows() %>%
  remove_empty_cols() %>%
  convert_to_NA(c("TBD", "PENDING")) %>%
  mutate(hire_date = excel_numeric_to_date(hire_date),
         main_cert = use_first_valid_of(certification, certification_2)) %>%
  select(-certification, -certification_2) # drop unwanted columns

roster
```

The core janitor cleaning function is `clean_names()` - call it whenever you load data into R.

### Examining dirty data

#### Finding duplicates
Use `get_dupes()` to identify and examine duplicate records during data cleaning.  Let's see if any teachers are listed more than once:
```{r}
roster %>% get_dupes(first_name, last_name)
```

Yes, some teachers appear twice.  We ought to address this before counting employees.

#### Tabulating tools
janitor has several functions for quick counts.  The big ones are `tabyl()` and `crosstab()`.

Notably, they can be called two ways:

* On vectors - e.g., `tabyl(roster$subject)`
* On a piped-in data.frame: `roster %>% tabyl(subject)`.
    * This allows for dplyr commands earlier in the pipeline

##### tabyl()

Like `table()`, but pipe-able and fully featured.

```{r}
roster %>%
  tabyl(subject)
```
##### crosstab()

```{r}
roster %>%
  filter(hire_date > as.Date("1950-01-01")) %>%
  crosstab(employee_status, full_time)
```

##### Prettifying
Other janitor functions dress up the results of these tabulation calls for fast, basic reporting.  Here are some of the functions that augment a summary table for reporting:
```{r}
roster %>%
  tabyl(employee_status, sort = TRUE) %>%
  add_totals_row()

roster %>%
  crosstab(full_time, employee_status) %>%
  adorn_crosstab(denom = "col", show_totals = TRUE)

```


Together, these tabulation functions reduce R's deficit against Excel and SPSS when it comes to quick, informative counts.
