2016-10-30

Per feedback from Duncan, I updated a url in README.md to begin https:// to fit the canonical format.  The rest of the package resubmission is the same as submitted earlier today, described as follows.

This is a patch release, fixing a test that was failing on R 3.2.5 for Windows.  Uwe Ligges notified me of this on October 23rd:

> *"find that your package faild under R-oldrelease (R-3.2.5) with the packages available there. Please fix or declare proper version dependencies and resubmit."*

I have also fixed three other small bugs, described in NEWS.md.  No other package behavior has changed.
