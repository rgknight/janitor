[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sfirke/janitor.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sfirke/janitor) [![Coverage Status](https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/sfirke/janitor/master.svg)](https://codecov.io/github/sfirke/janitor?branch=master) [![CRAN\_Status\_Badge](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/janitor)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=janitor) ![!Monthly Downloads](https://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/janitor) ![!Downloads](https://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/grand-total/janitor)

**janitor** has simple functions for examining and cleaning dirty data. It was built with beginning and intermediate R users in mind and is optimized for user-friendliness. Advanced R users can already do everything covered here, but with janitor they can do it faster and save their thinking for the fun stuff.

The main janitor functions:

-   perfectly format data.frame column names;
-   isolate partially-duplicate records; and
-   provide quick one- and two-variable tabulations (i.e., frequency tables and crosstabs).

Other janitor functions nicely format the results of these tabulations. Together, these tabulate-and-report functions approximate popular features of SPSS and Microsoft Excel.

janitor is a [\#tidyverse](https://github.com/hadley/tidyverse/blob/master/vignettes/manifesto.Rmd)-oriented package. Specifically, it plays nicely with the `%>%` pipe and is optimized for cleaning data brought in with the [readr](https://github.com/hadley/readr) and [readxl](https://github.com/hadley/readxl) packages.

### Installation

You can install:

-   the latest released version from CRAN with

    ``` r
    install.packages("janitor")
    ```

-   the latest development version from GitHub with

    ``` r
    if (packageVersion("devtools") < 1.6) {
      install.packages("devtools")
    }
    devtools::install_github("sfirke/janitor")
    ```

Using janitor
-------------

Below are quick examples of how janitor tools are commonly used. A full description of each function can be found in janitor's [catalog of functions](https://github.com/sfirke/janitor/blob/master/vignettes/introduction.md).

### Cleaning dirty data

Take this roster of teachers at a fictional American high school, stored in the Microsoft Excel file [dirty\_data.xlsx](https://github.com/sfirke/janitor/blob/master/dirty_data.xlsx): ![All kinds of dirty.](dirty_data.PNG)

Dirtiness includes:

-   Dreadful column names
-   Rows and columns containing Excel formatting but no data
-   Dates stored as numbers
-   Values spread inconsistently over the "Certification" columns

Here's that data after being read in to R:

``` r
library(pacman) # for loading packages
p_load(readxl, janitor, dplyr)

roster_raw <- read_excel("dirty_data.xlsx") # available at http://github.com/sfirke/janitor
glimpse(roster_raw)
#> Observations: 17
#> Variables: 12

#> $                   <dttm> NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA
```

Excel formatting led to an untitled empty column and 5 empty rows at the bottom of the table (only 12 records have any actual data). Bad column names are preserved.

Clean it with janitor functions:

``` r
roster <- roster_raw %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  remove_empty_rows() %>%
  remove_empty_cols() %>%
  convert_to_NA(c("TBD", "PENDING")) %>%
  mutate(hire_date = excel_numeric_to_date(hire_date),
         main_cert = use_first_valid_of(certification, certification_2)) %>%
  select(-certification, -certification_2) # drop unwanted columns

roster
#> # A tibble: 12 × 8
#>      first_name last_name employee_status    subject  hire_date percent_allocated full_time      main_cert
#>           <chr>     <chr>           <chr>      <chr>     <date>             <dbl>     <chr>          <chr>
#> 1         Jason    Bourne         Teacher         PE 2008-08-30              0.75       Yes    Physical ed

```

The core janitor cleaning function is `clean_names()` - call it whenever you load data into R.

### Examining dirty data

#### Finding duplicates

Use `get_dupes()` to identify and examine duplicate records during data cleaning. Let's see if any teachers are listed more than once:

``` r
roster %>% get_dupes(first_name, last_name)
#> # A tibble: 4 × 9
#>     first_name last_name dupe_count employee_status   subject  hire_date percent_allocated full_time
#>          <chr>     <chr>      <int>           <chr>     <chr>     <date>             <dbl>     <chr>
#> 1 Chien-Shiung        Wu          2         Teacher   Physics 1930-03-20              0.50       Yes
#> 2 Chien-Shiung        Wu          2         Teacher Chemistry 1930-03-20              0.50       Yes
#> 3        Jason    Bourne          2         Teacher        PE 2008-08-30              0.75       Yes
#> 4        Jason    Bourne          2         Teacher  Drafting 2008-08-30              0.25       Yes
#> # ... with 1 more variables: main_cert <chr>
```

Yes, some teachers appear twice. We ought to address this before counting employees.

#### Tabulating tools

janitor has several functions for quick counts. The big ones are `tabyl()` and `crosstab()`.

Notably, they can be called two ways:

-   On vectors - e.g., `tabyl(roster$subject)`
-   On a piped-in data.frame: `roster %>% tabyl(subject)`.
    -   This allows for dplyr commands earlier in the pipeline

##### tabyl()

Like `table()`, but pipe-able and fully featured.

``` r
roster %>%
  tabyl(subject)
#>       subject n    percent valid_percent
#> 1  Basketball 1 0.08333333           0.1
#> 2   Chemistry 1 0.08333333           0.1
#> 3        Dean 1 0.08333333           0.1
#> 4    Drafting 1 0.08333333           0.1
#> 5     English 2 0.16666667           0.2
#> 6       Music 1 0.08333333           0.1
#> 7          PE 1 0.08333333           0.1
#> 8     Physics 1 0.08333333           0.1
#> 9     Science 1 0.08333333           0.1
#> 10       <NA> 2 0.16666667            NA
```

##### crosstab()

``` r
roster %>%
  filter(hire_date > as.Date("1950-01-01")) %>%
  crosstab(employee_status, full_time)
#>   employee_status No Yes
#> 1  Administration  0   1
#> 2           Coach  2   0
#> 3         Teacher  3   4
```

##### Prettifying

Other janitor functions dress up the results of these tabulation calls for fast, basic reporting. Here are some of the functions that augment a summary table for reporting:

``` r
roster %>%
  tabyl(employee_status, sort = TRUE) %>%
  add_totals_row()
#>   employee_status  n    percent
#> 1         Teacher  9 0.75000000
#> 2           Coach  2 0.16666667
#> 3  Administration  1 0.08333333
#> 4           Total 12 1.00000000

roster %>%
  crosstab(full_time, employee_status) %>%
  adorn_crosstab(denom = "col", show_totals = TRUE)
#>   full_time Administration      Coach   Teacher     Total
#> 1        No       0.0% (0) 100.0% (2) 33.3% (3) 41.7% (5)
#> 2       Yes     100.0% (1)   0.0% (0) 66.7% (6) 58.3% (7)
```

Together, these tabulation functions reduce R's deficit against Excel and SPSS when it comes to quick, informative counts.
